## User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to be able to add events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage time effectively.

## Deployment

When the USER opens the planner CURRENT DAY is displayed at the top of the CALENDAR; when the USER scrolls down they are presented with timeblocks for business hours, which are color coded to indicate the time they represent.
When the USER clicks a timeblock they can schedule an event within it and it is saved in LOCAL STORAGE; when the USER refreshed the page, the scheduled events are still saved.
